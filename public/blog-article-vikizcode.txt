<h2>The Hook: Why I Started Building Instead of Just Learning</h2>

<p>I'm an engineering student. For the longest time, I was stuck in tutorial hell — watching course after course, building the same to-do apps, following along without really understanding.</p>

<p>Then I realized something: I wasn't building anything <em>mine</em>.</p>

<p>So I decided to create VikizCode — my own tech blog where I could document what I learn, share insights, and actually have something to show for all those hours spent coding.</p>

<p>This is the story of how I built it from scratch using Next.js. No fluff, no corporate speak — just the real process.</p>

<h2>Why I Built VikizCode</h2>

<p>Three reasons pushed me to finally start:</p>

<h3>1. Personal Brand</h3>
<p>In 2026, having a digital presence isn't optional anymore. Whether you're applying for internships or freelance gigs, people Google you. I wanted them to find something I built, not just my LinkedIn.</p>

<h3>2. Digital Survival Mindset</h3>
<p>The tech world moves fast. If you're not documenting what you learn, you're falling behind. I needed a place to organize my thoughts and share them publicly.</p>

<h3>3. Learning in Public</h3>
<p>There's something powerful about writing for an audience. It forces you to understand things deeply. Plus, helping others learn is the best way to solidify your own knowledge.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Tech Stack</h2>

<p>I didn't want to overcomplicate things. Here's what I chose and why:</p>

<h3>Next.js 14 (App Router)</h3>
<p>Next.js is the obvious choice for modern React apps. The App Router makes routing dead simple, and the developer experience is incredible. Plus, it's what most companies are using in 2026.</p>

<h3>Static Export</h3>
<p>I wanted my blog to be fast and cheap to host. Static export means no server costs, lightning-fast load times, and easy deployment anywhere.</p>

<h3>Tailwind CSS</h3>
<p>I'm not a designer. Tailwind lets me build decent-looking UIs without writing custom CSS. Utility classes might look messy at first, but once you get used to them, you move <em>fast</em>.</p>

<h3>GitHub + Netlify</h3>
<p>Version control with Git is non-negotiable. Netlify makes deployment stupidly easy — push to GitHub, and it auto-deploys. No DevOps headaches.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step: How I Built It</h2>

<h3>Creating the Next.js Project</h3>

<p>I started with the official Next.js starter:</p>

<pre><code>npx create-next-app@latest vikizcode
cd vikizcode
npm run dev</code></pre>

<p>Simple. Clean. No overthinking.</p>

<h3>Setting Up the Project Structure</h3>

<img src="/images/vikizcodeprojectstructure.png" alt="VikizCode project structure screenshot" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 12px; margin: 2rem 0;" />

<p>I organized everything into clear folders:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>app/</strong> — All my pages (home, about, contact, blog posts)</li>
<li><strong>components/</strong> — Reusable UI components (Header, Footer, ArticleCard)</li>
<li><strong>lib/</strong> — Data and utility functions</li>
<li><strong>public/</strong> — Static assets like images</li>
</ul>

<p>Keeping it simple meant I could find things quickly without getting lost in folders.</p>

<h3>Designing the UI</h3>

<p>I'm not a designer, so I kept things minimal. I used:</p>

<ul>
<li>A clean blue/indigo color palette</li>
<li>Plenty of white space</li>
<li>Simple card-based layouts</li>
<li>Subtle hover effects for interactivity</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal was "professional but approachable" — not too corporate, not too flashy.</p>

<h3>Handling Blog Routing</h3>

<p>Next.js App Router makes this easy. I created:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx</code> for individual blog posts</li>
<li>A data file in <code>lib/data.ts</code> to store all articles</li>
<li>Dynamic routing that pulls the right article based on the URL</li>
</ul>

<p>No database needed. Just TypeScript objects. Simple and fast.</p>

<h3>Static Generation</h3>

<p>I configured Next.js for static export in <code>next.config.js</code>:</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = {
  output: 'export',
  images: { unoptimized: true }
}</code></pre>

<p>This generates pure HTML/CSS/JS that can be hosted anywhere. No server required.</p>

<h3>Deployment and Going Live</h3>

<img src="/images/vikizcodenetlifydeploy.png" alt="Netlify deployment screen" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 12px; margin: 2rem 0;" />

<p>Deploying to Netlify was the easiest part:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pushed my code to GitHub</li>
<li>Connected my repo to Netlify</li>
<li>Set build command to <code>npm run build</code></li>
<li>Hit deploy</li>
</ol>

<p>Five minutes later, VikizCode was live on the internet.</p>

<h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>

<p>It wasn't all smooth sailing. Here's what tripped me up:</p>

<h3>Stack Confusion</h3>
<p>At first, I tried using a CMS, then considered a database, then thought about using MDX. I wasted days overthinking. Eventually, I just went with the simplest solution: a TypeScript file with article data.</p>

<h3>Overthinking Design</h3>
<p>I spent way too long tweaking colors and spacing. At some point, I had to accept that "good enough" is better than "perfect but never shipped."</p>

<h3>Deployment Fear</h3>
<p>I was scared to deploy. What if something broke? What if people hated it? Turns out, nobody cares as much as you think. Just ship it.</p>

<h3>Wanting Perfection</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge was my own perfectionism. I kept adding features, redesigning components, and delaying launch. Finally, I forced myself to go live with a basic version.</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>

<p>Building VikizCode taught me more than any tutorial ever could:</p>

<h3>Launch > Perfection</h3>
<p>A live, imperfect project is infinitely better than a perfect project that never launches. You can always improve later.</p>

<h3>Simplicity Wins</h3>
<p>I tried to add so many features — comments, analytics, newsletter integration. In the end, I stripped it all back. A simple blog that works is better than a complex one that's half-finished.</p>

<h3>Shipping Builds Confidence</h3>
<p>The moment I deployed VikizCode, I felt different. I wasn't just a student following tutorials anymore. I was someone who <em>builds things</em>.</p>

<h2>Final Advice for Engineering Students</h2>

<p>If you're reading this and thinking "I should build something too," here's my advice:</p>

<h3>Build Something Small</h3>
<p>Don't try to build the next Facebook. Build a blog. Build a portfolio. Build a simple tool you'd actually use. Small projects get finished.</p>

<h3>Deploy Publicly</h3>
<p>Don't keep your projects on localhost. Put them on the internet. It's scary, but it's the only way to get real feedback and feel like a real developer.</p>

<h3>Stop Waiting to Feel Ready</h3>
<p>You'll never feel 100% ready. I didn't know everything about Next.js when I started. I learned by building. That's how it works.</p>

<p>So go build something. Make it yours. Ship it. And then do it again.</p>

<p>That's how you actually learn.</p>
